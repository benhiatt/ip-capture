# README: ip-capture
	Description: Use the dark magic of JavaScript to capture and log local IP addresses.

Uses the web.py framework--can be hosted almost anywhere (including http://pythonanywhere.com, which I highly recommend).

Everything you need to know is in either app.py or about.html; the magic happens in index.html.

Contributions/suggestions are welcome, including for a better README than this one ;)
